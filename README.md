🌀 Flooder — The Terminal Color Flood Game

Flooder is a minimalist color-flood puzzle game built in pure Python using bext for terminal graphics.
The goal? Turn the entire board into a single color before your moves run out.
It’s simple, recursive, and dangerously addictive.

🎮 Gameplay

You start from the top-left tile (>), and each move floods connected tiles of the same color with your chosen color.
Choose wisely — every move counts.
If the entire board becomes one color before your moves run out, you win.
If not... well, you “loose motherflecker.” (If you know, you know — Suits reference 😏)
